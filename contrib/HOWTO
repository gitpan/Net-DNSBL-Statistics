Statistics HTML page HOWTO	version 1.01, 1-6-08

These files and scripts do the following:

dnsbl_compare.shtml	displays the explanation of how the data
			is created and the historical files available


contrib/stats2html.pl	converts the output of 'dnsblstat -w into a page
contrib/stats2list.pl	converts the history directory into an htmlized list
contrib/stats2page.sh	wraps the above two scripts
contrib/stat2generic.pl	extract the 'GENERIC' criteria from statistics.conf
			file and write an HTML page with the regexp's

Each of the script files will generate a brief HELP 
statement if executed without input arguments

# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # 

This HOWTO assumes that you have installed Net::DNSBL::Statistics, properly
edited the statistics.conf file and that you one or more source files
containing IP addresses. It does not matter if their are duplicates, the
'dnsblstat' script removes duplicates.

*	Edit dnsbl_compare.shtml to replace the logo image with your own 
	or if you don't have one with "&nbsp;"

*	create the directory structure

	/home/mydirectory/public_html/history
	/home/mydirectory/scripts
	/home/mydirectory/tmp

*	place 'dnsbl_compare.shtml' in the public_html directory

*	copy the script files to the 'scripts' directory
